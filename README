This is UTri, the Sandia Unstructured Triangle Tabular Interpolation
Package. UTri is distributed under the BSD License, see LICENSE.

Build Requirements
------------------

CMake (version 2.8.6 or later recommended)
C and FORTRAN compilers
MPI
NetCDF (version 4 specific features are not used)

Usage
-----

The main UTri interface is defined in the "utri_eos_mig.h" header
file. For details of usage please refer to the documentation in that
header. If using MPI, then one must also include the "utri_eos_mpi.h"
header. The basic work flow is:

Setup:
*) get a handle to the library by calling one of:

     utri_eos_handle_open()
     utri_eos_handle_init_mpi( MPI_Comm )
     utri_eos_handle_init_mpi_fortran( MPI_Fint * )

   Note that one can call the MPI versions passing MPI_COMM_NULL, which
   is equivalent to the non-MPI version. The second MPI version is meant
   to be called when one has a FORTRAN MPI communicator.

*) call utri_eos_init specifying the desired table for interpolation

Evaluation:
*) call utri_eos_XXdrv to evaluate the table at a desired location
   XX is px when using a pressure based table
   XX is either rt or re when using a density based table
*) check the error status of the utri_eos_XXdrv call
*) if desired, call utri_eos_status to get an informational string

Tear down:
*) call utri_eos_delete
*) call utri_eos_handle_close
